    <h1 style="color:bisque">A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The input can be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure or any number of other environmental phenomena.</h1>
    <h1 style="color:blueviolet">Sensors work by detecting physical changes in the device's environment and output them as analogue voltages or digital signals. This is then sent to a human-readable display where it can be monitored or transmitted, or relayed to other electronic devices for further processing.</h1>
